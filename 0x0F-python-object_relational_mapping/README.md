# Project: 0x0F. Python - Object-relational mapping | ALX Africa Intranet
**Author:** Joe-techie [Josh-techie](https://github.com/Josh-techie)

## Overview
This project is part of ALX Africa's curriculum and focuses on Python's Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) techniques, particularly using SQLAlchemy. The goal is to bridge the gap between Python programming and databases, enabling seamless interaction and data manipulation. By leveraging ORM, we abstract away the underlying SQL queries, making database operations more Pythonic and less dependent on specific storage solutions.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8.5
- MySQLdb version 2.0.x
- SQLAlchemy version 1.4.x
- pycodestyle version 2.8.*
- Ubuntu 20.04 LTS

## Installation and Setup
1. Install MySQL 8.0 for Ubuntu 20.04 by following the guide [here](https://example.com/mysql-installation-guide).

2. Create a Python Virtual Environment to manage dependencies:
   ```bash
   $ sudo apt-get install python3.8-venv
   $ python3 -m venv venv
   $ source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install MySQLdb version 2.0.x:
   ```bash
   $ sudo apt-get install python3-dev
   $ sudo apt-get install libmysqlclient-dev
   $ sudo apt-get install zlib1g-dev
   $ sudo pip3 install mysqlclient
   ```

4. Install SQLAlchemy version 1.4.x:
   ```bash
   $ sudo pip3 install SQLAlchemy
   ```

## Project Structure
- `0-select_states.py`: Lists all states from the database.
- `1-filter_states.py`: Lists states with names starting with 'N'.
- `2-my_filter_states.py`: Lists states based on user input.
- `3-my_safe_filter_states.py`: Lists states based on user input, preventing SQL injection.
- `4-cities_by_state.py`: Lists all cities from the database.
- `5-filter_cities.py`: Lists cities of a specified state.
- `model_state.py`: Contains the State class definition for SQLAlchemy.
- `6-model_state.py`: Creates the states table in the database.

## Usage
To run any of the provided scripts, use the following command format:
```bash
$ ./script_name.py <mysql_username> <mysql_password> <database_name> <additional_arguments>
```

Replace `<script_name.py>` with the name of the script you want to run and provide the necessary arguments as described in the task descriptions.

Make sure to grant the necessary permissions and ensure that your MySQL server is running when executing these scripts.

Please replace `<mysql_username>`, `<mysql_password>`, and `<database_name>` with the actual database credentials when using the scripts.
